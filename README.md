## Introduction
In collegiate basketball, team box scores are recorded for every game played, offering a wealth of performance data and an initial lens into what makes up a game. However, despite the abundance of available statistics, it remains unclear which combinations of metrics most significantly drive team success and how each team measures up. This project applies various multivariate techniques to NCAA Division 1 men’s basketball data to explore two central questions: (1) What hidden statistical patterns most strongly influence basketball game outcomes? and (2) Do teams naturally cluster into distinct playing styles based on these influential factors? The objective of this project is twofold: first, to reduce the dimensionality of performance metrics to uncover the most meaningful combinations of variables that explain game outcomes; and second, to identify distinct team archetypes based on how teams position themselves along these components. The findings aim to provide coaches, analysts, and team management with actionable insights for strategic planning, talent acquisition, and game preparation by revealing which statistical patterns truly matter for success and how different team compositions translate to on-court performance profiles.

## Methodology
The data set consists of comprehensive game-by-game box score statistics for all NCAA Division 1 men’s basketball teams during their 2024-2025 seasons scraped from sportsreference.com. This included team scores and game result as well as three-point and two-point field goal statistics (attempts, made, percentage), and number of blocks, free throws, rebounds, assists, turnovers, fouls and steals for both the home and away team. Any missing values in the data set were dropped prior to analysis. These statistics looked at a team perspective and did not include individual player statistics. 

To gain an initial understanding of what box score variables may be important in determining success we chose to run both a classifier (on win/loss) and regressor (on total number of points) decision tree. However, due to the high number of variables it became difficult to interpret the results. To address this, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality and simplify interpretation. Additionally, a factor analysis was conducted to uncover potential underlying relationships between variables. Lastly, clustering was performed to gain an overall understanding of the dataset in a way that was relevant for potential audiences. Analysis was run in Python and included the following modules/functions: Scikit-learn: DecisionTreeRegressor, DecisionTreeclassifier, PCA, FactorAnalysis, KMeans and SciPy: dendrogram, linkage.

## Results
Decision Tree
In the decision tree regressor, assists emerged as the most significant predictor of total wins, particularly when isolating teams with the highest win counts. It was the only variable with a consistent and strong impact in this context. Supporting variables such as free throw attempts, 2-point percentage, and 3-point percentage also contributed to win outcomes, but to a lesser extent. It is interesting to see that there is no mention of variables that are related to defensive or passing play. Meanwhile, in the classifier model, assists again stood out as the most critical factor: teams averaging more than 14.5 assists per game were almost guaranteed to win, while those below that threshold were far more likely to lose. Defensive rebounds followed as the second most influential feature in the classification model, underscoring the importance of both offensive coordination and defensive control in predicting team success.

## PCA
We ran three different PCAs to capture the specific kinds of variance across games. This PCA variance explains how games differ from each other, with each PC a specific pattern of variation. In the first PCA that we ran we included all variables to get a general understanding of overall game types. We found that PC1 demonstrated variance across strong team performance (shooting, rebounding, passing) and opponent suppression. PC2 was representative of more chaotic, foul-heavy games where teams spend a lot of time at the free-throw line. Fouls and free throws were the most heavily loaded in the positive range and for both home and opponent teams. The last PC3 was more focused on opponent offensive strength (opponents taking and making a lot of shots). 

The second PCA we ran included all statistically significant variables as determined from a multiple linear regression. This PCA showed very similar component loadings and takeaways as the first one, especially for the first two components. PC1 showed games dominated by strong defense and rebounding, oppressing opponent shooting and passing. PC2, again showed games where more fouls and free throws accounted for the most variance. PC3 differed the most from the previous PCA. Here the PC loadings were skewed negatively where the home team had poor shooting and poor assists rather than being positively loaded on the opponent team's good performance.
 
The last PCA that we ran was only on statistically significant variables for the home team in order to focus on only what a specific team can control and create game type recommendations accordingly. Here we see that PC1 accounts for over 20% of the variance among the data which is quite a bit higher than in the other PCAs previously ran. This PC interestingly focuses strongly on rebounding, defense, and team play without much loadings on scoring variables. The scoring comes into play in PC2 where the loadings are more prevalent on high free throws and offensive rebounds. This suggests that what makes the biggest difference in game variance is defensive play and assists over actual scoring. The last PC3 is representative of games with more fouls, more turnovers, more free throws which is similar to what we found in the previous PCAs.

## Factor Analysis
We ran two different factor analyses using a similar rationale to the PCA analysis. Three factors were chosen as a result of a scree plot. Similar to PCA2 and PCA3 we looked at the significant values from our regression analysis and did not use all values in the dataset. We did this because there is significant collinearity between variables. We wanted to break the data down into only the meaningful metrics and establish factors from those data points. 

Our first factor analysis looks at all significant variables, including home and away team stats. We notice that the first factor places a heavy emphasis on fouls and free throw attempts. We can interpret this factor as game cleanliness and ball control. Our second factor is loaded primarily on offensive statistics and our third factor is loaded on rebounding and blocking, placing a higher emphasis on defense.

When opponent statistics were omitted, the structure shifted slightly. Offensive performance became the primary component,  while fouls, free throws, and turnovers defined Factor 2. This reordering highlights how internal team behavior, independent of opponent influence, can alter the interpretation of key performance drivers.

## Clustering
In order to gain a better understanding of potential playing styles and strategies, we applied both K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to the data. By aggregating the games by team, we obtained a more comprehensive overview that allowed us to compare teams across the entire season. We applied both clustering methods after reducing dimensionality of the statistically significant variables through PCA, using PC1 and PC2 for visualization and analysis. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we employed both the elbow method and silhouette analysis, which indicated k = 3 as the optimal choice as a balance of the inflection point and enhanced interpretability. For hierarchical clustering, we used Ward’s linkage method to generate a dendrogram. A cutoff at the level corresponding to three clusters was selected, consistent with the K-means result. Analysis of PCA loadings revealed that clusters higher on PC1 contained teams that had higher opponent game stats while clusters higher on PC2 contained teams that had more free throws, rebounds, and blocks.

## Discussion
A key insight from both decision tree models was the critical role of assists in determining game outcomes. The classification tree, in particular, revealed a sharp threshold: teams that recorded more than 14.5 assists per game were overwhelmingly likely to win, while those below this mark faced a significantly higher risk of losing. This suggests that ball movement and playmaking are not just beneficial, but essential to team success. Assists are a proxy for offensive coordination reflecting a team’s ability to create high-quality shot opportunities through passing and teamwork rather than relying on individual effort. The finding emphasizes the strategic value of systems and play styles that prioritize spacing, off-ball movement, and unselfish distribution, as these actions open up more efficient scoring chances. 

This is similar to findings of both Conte and Cabarkapa who analyzed NCAA Men’s basketball in the 2013-14 seasons and 2018-19 seasons. While their analysis highlighted the importance of scoring, looking primarily at 2 and 3 point shots, they did note that teams that win games also see a higher quantity of assists. It is possible that our analysis over-emphasizes the role of assists in the game of basketball as an assist is only recorded when a shot is made. There is not a box score metric that looks to see if a missed shot would have had an assist. Recording this new metric would point to a more cohesive understanding of how assists affect the game. It is possible this analysis overweights assists due to its relationship with scoring.

In addition to assists, our classifier decision tree also highlighted the importance of defensive rebounds in actually securing wins — a factor that did not emerge as significant in our regression tree predicting points scored. This distinction underscores that while offensive performance drives scoring, possession control through defensive rebounding is a key driver of game outcomes. Teams that effectively limit second-chance opportunities for their opponents not only prevent easy points but also regain offensive momentum. As such, defensive rebounding should be viewed as a foundational element of winning strategy, even if it doesn’t directly influence scoring totals.

Another important theme that emerged from our analysis was the role of game quality and consistency. The PCA loadings showed that most games are shaped by a balance of scoring efficiency, defensive ability, and opponent suppression. These elements often defined the structure of high-quality matchups, where one team clearly outperformed the other through coordinated offense and effective defense. However, the PCA also highlighted a cluster of games that deviated from this norm— characterized by high variability and a lack of dominance from either side, suggesting chaotic or sloppy play. These matches often featured inconsistent performance across key metrics, reinforcing the importance of team consistency as a differentiator. Regardless of opponent quality or game flow, teams that maintain disciplined execution are more likely to prevail, especially in games that lack structure or control.

Factor analyses provided interesting insights into collinearity between variables and examined the relationship between the home and away team stats. While both factor analyses provide important results to take into account, removing the opposing team’s statistics paints a better picture from a coach’s perspective. While defense is important, most of the factors measured are directly linked to the opposition. A team could have an off night shooting or foul considerably more than expected. These are not factors that the home team can have a direct impact on. A coach cannot direct the other team to “shoot worse” or “foul more” but they can direct their team to drive to the basket or lock in more on a particular player. From an actionable standpoint, factor analysis 2 is the most useful to a coach, showing that unselfish offensive basketball is key to winning games, followed closely by playing clean and avoiding fouls. 

The cluster analysis identified three distinct team archetypes with important strategic implications for coaches and management, notably revealing a clear performance hierarchy amongst clusters. The physical, defensive-minded teams (cluster 0) not only excel in rebounding and drawing fouls but also had the highest average win rate across the teams. Perimeter-oriented teams (cluster 1) maintained the second-highest average win rate while facing opponents with efficient outside shooting and maintaining decent defensive fundamentals. Teams with defensive vulnerabilities (cluster 2) recorded the lowest win rate, suggesting that allowing efficient opponent scoring severely hampers competitive performance despite varied offensive approaches. Coaches can leverage this framework to maximize their team’s strengths and exploit opponent weaknesses throughout the season as well as making roster construction decisions.

## Limitations
One key limitation of the current analysis is the lack of contextual or environmental factors, which can significantly influence game outcomes. Future iterations of this analysis should incorporate variables such as home versus away games, total possession time, and distinctions between regular season and postseason games to better capture game dynamics. The current focus on team-level analysis rather than individual player performance may also overlook important nuances such as the impact of injury, star players, and age and height distribution on overall success. Lastly, there is a limitation in the interpretability of the principal components derived from the PCA, particularly PC1. While PC1 captures a significant portion of the variance in the data set, it primarily reflects intuitive features such as strong team performance and effective opponent suppression. Although statistically valid these findings may lack analytical depth, as they restate what is already commonly understood about basketball gameplay. This suggests the need to either refine the input variables or complement the current analysis with other techniques that can reveal less obvious patterns within the data.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this analysis highlights the central role of assists in determining game outcomes, surpassing even ball control and defensive metrics in predictive importance. While our models position assists as a key driver of offensive success, they may also be a byproduct of made shots, warranting further investigation into their true impact. PCA and clustering analyses underscore the value of consistent, unselfish scoring and disciplined defense, revealing that teams with defensive weaknesses often struggle to generate offensive momentum as well. Overall, teams that excel through coordinated offense and focused defense tend to outperform their peers, though future research should integrate contextual factors such as injuries, player-specific performance, and game location to provide deeper strategic insights.
